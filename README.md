### FPGA-emulated Ising Machine under Dr. Taskin
Personal codebase for research under Dr. Taskin, related to the development of an FPGA-based emulation of an oscillator-based combinatorial optimization machine based on the Ising model.

**Tools Used**

`SystemVerilog`
`Questa/ModelSim`
`Visual Studio Code`
`Git`

#### **File Structure**

`/docs` –> Extra documentatation of the design process, including high-level block diagrams, reasoning, etc.\
`/src`  –> Main module files written in SystemVerilog\
`/tb`   –> Testbenches for module files for RTL verification in Questa/ModelSim\
